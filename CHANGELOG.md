## Release 3.x.x

### Backward incompatibilities

This release introduces backward incompatibilities.

The major incompatibility is that `unbound.conf(5)` is now empty, allowing
users to build arbitrary one.

Also, `chroot(8)` support has been dropped.

As a result, the following variables have been removed.

* `unbound_config_chroot`
* `unbound_freebsd_chroot_devfs_ruleset_number`
* `unbound_config_server`
* `unbound_config_remote_control_control_enable`
* `unbound_config_remote_control_control_use_cert`
* `unbound_config_remote_control_control_interface`
* `unbound_config_remote_control_extra`
* `unbound_forward_zone`
* `unbound_stub_zone`
